# WWDC-Playground

This is an updated version of the playground that I submitted with my WWDC 2017 scholarship application. It generates MIDI files according to a set of rules (using the [Swift MIDI generating library](https://github.com/18praveenb/Swift-MIDI-Playground) I wrote) and plays it back with AVMIDIPlayer.
